Costa AC, Ahamed T, Jordan D, Stephens GJ (2023) "The Markov worm: bridging scales in *C. elegans* behavior"

This model is able to predict worm foraging behavior across scales, from sub-second posture movements to minutes long search strategies, bridging from posture to path through a combination of delay embedding, Markov modelling and resistive force theory.
